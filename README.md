# TRACE
TRACE is an interactive fitness tracker created by Mina Oh, Rachel Dodell, and Maddie Kim for Tangible User Interfaces at Wellesley College. Our project expands an average person’s artistic toolset by enabling an individual to create art through movement — which allows for a more accessible platform for an audience that was excluded from creating their own pieces through traditional methods. Our goal is to make walking, running, dancing, and other forms of movement into a richer artistic expression by create a visualization and a creative experience through our interface. TRACE allows users to preserve represent and preserve their movements in a beautiful visualization keepsake.
